/r/serendipity is a meta-subreddit meant to broaden the perspective of 
its subscribers. It takes a popular entry from a random subreddit and 
posts it every few hours. If you want to increase your exposure to niche 
subreddits, or just your perspective on things on the web in general, 
serendipity might help you do that. But it might not. It's a bot, after 
all.
