/r/serendipity is a meta-subreddit meant to broaden the perspective of 
its subscribers. It takes a popular entry from a random subreddit and 
posts it every few hours. If you want to increase your exposure to niche 
subreddits, or just your perspective on things on the web in general, 
serendipity might help you do that. But it might not. It's a bot, after 
all.

## BIG OL DISCLAIMER ##

This is very much hacky-script level territory, and shouldn't be used for
anything that really matters. If you want to do something with it, I'm glad,
but it's just an ugly script. Really.

TO RUN:

Serendipity requires httplib2 and OpenSSL. build_subreddits.py requires lxml as well.

You'll likely want to stick these scripts in your cron, something to the effect of:

0 */3 * * * python /path/to/serendipity/main.py # Post a serendipity link every 3 hours
0 0 1 */3 * python /path/to/serendipity/build_subreddits.py # Rebuild our subreddits list every 3 months
